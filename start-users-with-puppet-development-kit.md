# Start Users with Puppet Development Kit (PDK)

# Summary

The PDK is a Puppet maintained open source project for creating, validating, and testing puppet module code. It should be the preferred option for users when talking about creating new modules or writing new puppet code.

# Expectations

All users should be directed to use the PDK for their initial module creation, validation, and unit testing process.

The exception might be advanced users with high functioning automated testing that has greater capabilities than the PDK.

# Standard Details

## Preferred Option

Introduce the PDK to new or existing users who would benefit from its capabilities. Guiding users to the PDK is preferred because it is maintained and will see continued development and improvement.

## Alternate Options

For users with more advanced needs there may be other tools which are used in addition to or instead of the PDK. For example, `onceover`, `octo-catalog-diff`, or `retrospec` provide capabilities which the PDK does not yet have. In these cases the PDK team should be made aware of the use cases that can be solved to improve the PDK.

## Discouraged Options

A number of other tools exist for creating module skeletons and should be avoided unless there are very compelling reasons. The PDK will continue to see development and improvements if there are any reasons to use a different module skeleton then that information should be fed back into the PDK development process.
